<li>How do you know when information on the internet is reliable?</li>
<li>How can you tell when it isn’t reliable?</li>
</ul>

<li class="fragment"><p>Tip! Discuss with learners the history of fake news, and ask them to give examples of fake news from the past and present, and why it may seem more prominent today (i.e. Fake news is nothing new. However because of social media, false stories can reach more people more quickly than viral emails could accomplish in the past.)</p></li>
<li class="fragment"><p>Tip! Discuss the difference between misinformation (information that is false) and disinformation (information is false and deliberately meant to deceive).</p>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Point out that we can pay attention to what we’re noticing and feeling online, and use these responses plus a set of criteria to help us be better web detectives.<br />
</li>

<li>Facilitator should let the group generate these, but can gently guide or fill-in with a few suggestions and prompts, such as: sources, authors– backgrounds, capabilities, freshness/date, familiarity of site/source, design of site, writing style/spelling, advertising, other stories on site, etc.</li>
<li>Try to come to agreement on each rule. List doesn’t need to be exhaustive– aim for 6 or so items.</li>
<li>If there is controversy, don’t eliminate rules, but keep them to the side.</li>
<li>Allow for discussion of rules, and acknowledge that criteria that works for some might not work for others.</li>
<li>Document shared rules on a large sheet of paper, blackboard or flip chart and post where everyone can see them.</li>
<li>There will be a chance to add or revise the list after the activity.</li>

<li><p>NOTE: These represent two different sets of stories: 1-4 about a shape found in a google Earth image and 5-8 about new underwater video footage. Facilitator can limit to 1-4 or 5-8 as needed, or give each group a different set.</p></li>
<li><p>Groups should spend 20 minutes researching together. Facilitator frames this activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remind learners that they’ve got a fairly specific question, “is the Kraken, a 100- to 120-foot tentacled sea creature that attacks and sink ships, real?”</li>
<li>Write the question and post it in the room, ensure that there aren’t any questions or confusion about this question and that it’s clear to everyone.</li>
<li>Suggest that learners use the research question to guide their work.</li>
<li>Hand out blank score sheets to track evaluation of each site.</li>
<li>Explain that learners should summarize the content of each site in a few points at the top of the sheet– the basic idea or message</li>
<li>Ask learners to list:
<ul>
<li>the agreed upon rules (and any other they want to use) in column 1</li>
<li>Scores (plus/minus) go in column 2</li>
<li>Notes and comments go in column 3 – what do you notice? How does the site look? How does the content make you feel?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Tips! Encourage learners to talk through their thinking and observations together while they explore and score.</li>
<li class="fragment">Tips! Encourage learners to click around the websites where these stories were posted for more info about the source, the author, the sponsors, etc.</li>
<li class="fragment">Tips! Encourage learners to think about the timeline of the stories– when did they appear? which are most recent? How are the sources and stories connected?</li>
</ul>

<section id="did-anything-surprise-you" class="slide level3">
<h3>Did anything surprise you?</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>[10-20 minutes]</p>
<pre><code>* Did anything surprise you?
* Was there a difference between the headline and the main idea? 
* What differences did you notice in the story from site to site?
* What did you feel when reading or looking at the sites? Were some more fun/exciting than others? 
* Which sites felt most trustworthy? Which didn’t? Did you validate sources online? 
* Are there any new rules you’d propose for the list?
* Who owns the site? How can we discover the site’s purpose? When was the page created? </code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Revise the list of rules, and discuss as needed.</li>
<li>Share results of the research question– what are their answers? How did the list of rules help?</li>
<li>Conclusion: Given these stories, we can say that the kraken, a 100- to 120-foot tentacled sea creature that attacks and sink ships, is probably NOT real. In the first story, a rock island is mistaken for a kraken. In the second story, video has been shot of a giant squid, but it is much smaller and shyer than the kraken we are looking for, though it may have inspired the legends.</li>

<li>Explain to learners that they’ve tested their list on a set of curated resources– news items that were picked in advance. Now, they can test out their lists on news and info sources that they find, “in the wild.”</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li class="fragment">Tip! Be sure learners frame their question clearly, that it is focused on proving or disproving a specific fact .</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Ask learners to do a web search to find 3 or 4 different sources on this controversy.</li>
<li>Ask them to use the same process in the previous section to evaluate the claim.</li>
<li>Bring the group back together to share results. Ask learners:
<ul>
<li>Were some of the results different, or was there a consensus?</li>
<li>Which sources were reliable? Which sources did you decide were unreliable?</li>

<li class="fragment">Tip! Explain to learners that some of these lists are made for and by journalists, who write and publish news– before the internet, these were the “gatekeepers” of factual information.
