# The WebLit Core Curriculum Overview README

The purpose of Mozillaâ€™s Core Web Literacy Curriculum is to provide learners with a basic conceptual understanding of how to read, write, and participate on the web. The Core Activities were written to be self-sufficient and developed from new as well as remixing existing activities with the goal of aligning with the [Web Literacy Map](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy). 

Web literacy for example helps people:
* Understand how the Internet works and connects different parts of the web.
* Share information with others in ways that make sense and protect their privacy and security.
* Evaluate information, and spot misinformation and disinformation. 
* Empower themselves and their communities to participate online as citizens, learners, workers, creators, consumers, and people.

Developing this core curriculum has truly been a community effort involving staff, volunteer contributors, and allied organizations from around the world. A special shout-out to the [library pilots](https://learning.mozilla.org/blog/mozilla-imls-web-literacy-for-library-staff-pilots-kick-off-meeting), and the web literacy leaders and their respective public library staff: Sherry Lehane, Davis Erin Anderson, Joanna Milner, Liz Dyer, Melanie Wilson, and Matthew Kopel for all their contributions, as well as Randy MacDonald and Iris Bond Gill. A big thank you to Matt Rogers and [Digitalme](https://digitalme.co.uk/) for making web literacy badges a reality.

#### Open Practices

Working open is one of the underlying tenants of the core curriculum, and also one of web literacy skills. One of the first steps in implementing the core curriculum is understanding what it means to work in the open. Thus, we encourage you to take this one hour, free [working in the open workshop](https://mozilla.teachable.com/p/open-leadership-101) to learn the basics of participation, collaboration, and sharing on community-driven projects. 

#### Spread, Grow, and Improve the Curriculum

This core curriculum is meant to be self-sufficient and catalyze communities around the world to use, spread, grow, and improve it. Thus, please spread the word on why it's important for people in their everyday lives to have these core skills, and let everyone know how the curriculum is being utilized and forked for continuous improvement. 

Here is how you can contribute:

* Tell us [how and where you're using the curriculum](https://github.com/mozilla/web-lit-core/issues/8); we'd also like to know [what you've learned and what might you change](https://github.com/mozilla/web-lit-core/issues/9).
* translate into different languages
* remix for different audiences
* continually improve the curriculum-- see this [list of tasks and modifications](https://github.com/mozilla/web-lit-core/issues) we need help with! 

[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this repository. Forking is making a copy and creating your own version of this project you can edit and use. Here is also another resource for [forking](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes).

#### Printout Curriculum from GitHub

The best way to do this is opening GitHub in the Chrome browser. 

#### Share your Remixes

For anyone remixing and creating own custom version of the curriculum, we encourage you to add your remixes to https://www.mozillapulse.org/issues/web-literacy.

#### Earning Digital Badges

Digitalme through their [Open Badges Academy](https://www.openbadgeacademy.com/mozilladirectory) is offering digital badges for the web literacy skills if you are interested in earning or having your learners earn badges. To help you with assessment of badges, we created these [guidelines](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19QAgcMiVkkAILcT8PZwohrC5A5Y-eUxEw6FUmsp7zRM/edit) to help organizations and programs that are implementing badging systems and systems for assessing their badges.
